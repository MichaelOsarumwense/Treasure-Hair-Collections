            <h4>Are these hair actually in stock?</h4>
            <p>At TH-Collections, we stock all of our hairs listed on this website  and we currently hold over 100,000 hairs in stock. So, unlike some of our competitors, we ship our hairs directly from our stock so you can be assured of speedy delivery. We hold our stock in a high security warehouse, and our stock turnover is rapid - so you won't receive an old hair that has been used, or one that has been sitting on a beauty shelve for years. We pride ourself in dispatching nearly 100% of orders on time.</p>
            <h4>Do your hairs come with guarantees?</h4>
            <p>Yes, all of our hairs come with the full international manufacturer's guarantee. You can purchase from us assured with the knowledge that your hair is fully guaranteed for the full period against faults.</p>
            <h4>How do you send the hairs?</h4>
            <p>Items are shipped by Royal Mail and you also have the option in the checkout to use a courier if you prefer. Next day delivery is available on all orders. This method of delivery is fully insured. Certain items under £60 are sent by Royal Mail First Class Delivery by default, however you can always upgrade to Special Delivery in the checkout. 9am delivery is also available in the checkout process.</p>
            <h4>Can I pay by cheque?</h4>
            <p>We no longer accept cheques as payment</p>
            <h4>How much is delivery?</h4>
            <p>Delivery is free of charge for all orders within Republic of Ireland. Delivery to international locations is calculated in the checkout.</p>
            <h4>Can you deliver on a Sunday?</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, we are unable to deliver on Sundays at this time.</p>
